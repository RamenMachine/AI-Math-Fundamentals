# HW3 - Python Week 3: PageRank Algorithm

This assignment implements Google's PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on their link structure.

## Implementation

Three core functions:

1. **Normalize(A)**: Converts an adjacency matrix to a normalized form where each column sums to 1
2. **PageRank(L, iter=100)**: Computes rank vectors iteratively using matrix multiplication
3. **SearchResults(r)**: Returns pages sorted by rank in descending order

## Example Output

For a 4-page network, the algorithm produces:
- Page 3: 0.3999963896 (highest rank)
- Page 2: 0.2400024908
- Page 1: 0.2400024908
- Page 0: 0.1199986288 (lowest rank)

## Technologies
- Python 3.13
